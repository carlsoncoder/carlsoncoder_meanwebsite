<p>I'm Justin, and I love software development and all things technical!</p>

<p>Technology and Software Development are a passion of mine.  While I work as a Software Engineering Manager in my day job and don't write any code in my day job, coding is still one of my major hobbies/pastimes, and I find plenty of time off hours to work on my craft.  Before I became a manager, I worked pretty much exclusively with the .NET stack - primarily C# and ASP.NET Web Forms.   However, I've broadened my horizons quite a bit since then.  I'm still most comfortable in C#, however, I've also dabbled in NodeJS, Java, Android, iOS, Python, and C/C++ development as well.</p>

<p>Besides software development, I play guitar, hack around with micro-controllers (the Raspberry Pi and Arduino are AWESOME!), play my PS4, and keep up with this blog.  I also am a proud supporter of the 2nd amendment, and take any chance I can to get out to the range and perforate some paper.</p>
